# CAT - Crypto Asset Tracker

This is basically only my intro to Android Kotlin, guys. Still have much to learn and practice. Hope you have a good feedback!

### Actually it is not for tracking anything, lol. But I have a plan to use API or something to track either our portfolio or as simple as recent prices of the cryptos. NB: if i am not lazy
